Natural Language to SQL Query Converter

By Eric Sun

This is a full stack app that converts natural language English to SQL queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture and text completion API. The app has a client and a server, each with its own npm packages.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the root directory. There are two folders in the root directory: client and server. Each folder has its own package.json file and node_modules folder.

Installing Dependencies
To install the dependencies for the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and run the following command:

npm install

To install the dependencies for the server, navigate to the root folder and run the following command:

npm install

Next upload your openapi key into .env file

Then just run: npm run dev
